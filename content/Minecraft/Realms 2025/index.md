This year's Realm has been a ride. It has been most easily divided into two parts: PVP and normal Minecraft. The first part ended on the __4th of June__, which I recapped that day. The second part started on __June 5th__ at around 20:00. So far it has been quite competitive in the terms of wealth, but it has been a lot nicer. We no longer need to spend 6 hours a day on it just to make sure you don't fall behind!
