This is my new Hugo site. I am making it to learn, advertise, and to host my "blog". I really just want it to be something that I use to put down stuff that I think is cool and have fun.

The [Wiki](/wiki) is where I will host information. Right now it doesn't have much but I think it could end up being quite useful!

I plan to add a [Projects](Projects) folder where I will advertise my GitHub repos. They will most likely just be summaries of the READMEs plus a picture.

## Inspiration
I started this when I wanted to host Minecraft information, and then I saw a YouTube video about incorporating Obsidian MD into Hugo and I immediately set it up. It took a few hours but it was well worth it! Below is the tutorial I used.
