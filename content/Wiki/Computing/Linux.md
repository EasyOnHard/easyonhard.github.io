Linux is a great but it can be a bit scary to start. The goal of this guide is to guide you through the process of choosing what you want, personalization, and actually using it.

## The Distro
In Linux, there are many different flavors, or __Distros__, to choose from. They all come with different perks and disadvantages, and choosing the correct one can be daunting. 

### What actually is a Distro?
Like I said above, a Distro is basically a different _flavor_ of Linux. They are all built on the Linux Kernel, the software that interfaces with the hardware. 

Each Distro comes with different pre-installed software and utilities, such as the default desktop environment (DE) or package repositories (such as the AUR for Arch). 

### The "Mother Distros" 
Almost every Linux distribution can trace back to one of these three Distros: Arch, Debian, and Red Hat. These are the more "minimal" Distros, and they each have pros and cons.

#### Arch
Arch is one of the more iconic distros, known for its learning curve and minimalism.

**Pros:**
- **Rolling Release:** you can always have the newest versions of software.
- **Customization:** you can build your system from the ground up.
- **Documentation:** The Arch Wiki contains a vast amount of information on just about everything.
**Cons:**
- **The Learning Curve:** Arch forces you into the command line (CLI), so you need to know how to navigate it.
- **Stability:** Because of the rolling-release model, incompatibilities and bugs are frequent.
- **Installation:** Installing Arch takes a long time and a ton of willpower, though it has gotten much easier. 

#### Debian
Debian is another common distro, and it is very easy to set up and get going.

**Pros:**
- **Stability:** packages are thoroughly vetted and tested before released.
- **Community:** there is a large and helpful userbase that can help you through almost any problem.
**Cons:**
- **Older Software**: You don't get the newest versions of your software, which can be a major drawback

#### Red Hat
Red Hat is most popular in Enterprise application, so it might not be the best option for beginners on Home PCs.

**Pros:**
- **Security:** Strong focus on security.
- **Fedora:** Feel like a real Linux user with a neckbeard, fedora, and your PC running Fedora.
**Cons:**
- **Cost:** typically not free, as it is designed for enterprise application.
- **Limited Flexibility:** its strong focus on security and stability make it a bad option for people who like to mess around with fancy lights.

#### Choosing the Family
Do you want flexibility, minimalism, and full control? **Arch**.
Do you want something that just works, a strong userbase, and stability? **Debian.**
Are you an enterprise or have a Fedora? **Red Hat.**

Of course there is more nuance, and I recommend doing some research on whatever one looks most appealing before going all-in.


## Software
The software is the stuff like your File Explorer, Browser, Desktop,Terminal, etc. Many Distros come with their own suite of these programs, but many are purely minimal and you need to chose your own. 

### Desktops
The desktop is a good place to start, as being able to see is nice. There are two main types of desktop: **Desktop Environments (DEs)** and **Window Managers (WMs)**.

#### Desktop Environments
Desktop Environments are the more straightforward option for beginners. They have task bars, start menus, and a suite of programs to use. 

I like **KDE Plasma**, but you can find more [here.](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-desktop-environments/)

#### Window Managers
Window Managers manage the windows on your screen, including their placement and scaling. Typically when WMs are mentioned they are talking about **Tiling WMs**, a fancy type that organizes the windows into a grid of "tiles" and allows you to place them where ever you want.

My favorite WM is **Hyprland**, a very pretty WM that allows for a high degree of customization and modernity. For more WMs  and better explanations, check out [this article.](https://itsfoss.com/best-window-managers/)
