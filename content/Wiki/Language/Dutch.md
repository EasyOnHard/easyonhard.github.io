## Conjugation

Look [here](https://www.verbix.com/languages/dutch)for any irregular conjugations that aren't listed below.

## Present Tense
#### Regular
There ones are easy. In the singulars you **drop the ending** (-en in most cases) and add an ending. 1st person singular **doesn't have one**, but jij/u/zij/hij all end with **-t**. The plurals are just the **infinitives**!

For example, here is **drinken**, or _to drink_.

| Drinken | Singular | Plural  |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1st     | Drink    | Drinken |
| 2nd     | Drinkt   | Drinken |
| 3rd     | Drinkt   | Drinken |

#### Irregular
My worst nightmare: irregular conjugation. Just like in every language, Dutch has irregularities. It seems that _to be_ is very often irregular, like the Spanish _Ser/Estar_, and Dutch's **zijn**:

| Zijn | Singular | Plural |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| 1st  | ben      | zijn   |
| 2nd  | bent     | zijn   |
| 3rd  | is       | zijn   |
"u", the formal _you_, can take **bent or is**, with the later being more formal.

Here are **Hebben** (_to have_) and **Gaan** (_to go_):

| Hebben | Singular | Plural |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1st    | heb      | hebben |
| 2nd    | hebt     | hebben |
| 3rd    | heeft    | hebben |

| Gaan | Singular | Plural |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| 1st  | ga       | gaan   |
| 2nd  | gaat     | gaan   |
| 3rd  | gaat     | gaan   |


**Kunnen** and **Willen** are also good to know:

| Kunnen | Singular | Plural |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1st    | kan      | kunnen |
| 2nd    | kunt     | kunnen |
| 3rd    | kan      | kunnen |
**Kan** can be used with **jij** informally

| Willen | Singular | Plural |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1st    | wil      | willen |
| 2nd    | wilt     | willen |
| 3rd    | wil      | willen |
