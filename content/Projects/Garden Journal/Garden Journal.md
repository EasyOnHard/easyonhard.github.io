# About
This journal is a history of my garden, in which I will include illustrations (On the physical version), data, and tips/notes. All data will be relevant to growing zone 6b.

# Plants
%% This is the section where I will keep all of the info on different plants.  https://www.herbalhaven.com/products/ has good data %%

This is where I am keeping all of my data on the plants themselves. Each one will gen one paper: one side will be raw information, the second will have uses and growth graphs.

## Mints
Mints are easy-going, hardy plants. I put them in the most accessible spot in my bed because they need some maintenance so that they don't overtake each other; They are very aggressive spreaders. 

You typically don't want mints to flower unless you want the look. The leaves are the main appeal.

When you harvest, be sure not to take more than a third of the plant to ensure rapid regrowth. When you to, snip above leaf nodes, ideally in the morning for optimal flavor.
### Info
Sun: Full to partial shade
Water: Likes moisture, hard to over-water
Soil: Anything but dry
Problems: Hardy. Not much to worry about
Overwinters? Yes

### Chocolate Mint
Scientific: _Mentha Ã— piperita f. citrata_

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%
#### Notes
This mint creeps put out after heavy rain. When it creeps, the runners son't have many leaves and can be hard to spot. 

This mint tastes great and can be used as a good tea, as well as any mint flavoring, such as ice cream.

### Thai Mint
Scientific: *Mentha arvensis*

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%
#### Notes
Quite spicy, good as a main flavor in teas. Be sure to balance with other flavors for a smoother taste.

The mint tends to grow vertically before outwards.

### Peppermint
Scientific: *Mentha x pipierta*

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%
#### Notes
Another good tea herb, it is quite pleasing and is a bit less potent than Thai. It is good for calming you down.

Peppermint likes to grow lush before spreading, though it does sent out runners.

## Basil
Scientific: _Ocimum basilicum_

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%

Basil is another must-have in any garden. It is generally quite easy to maintain, but it can take a while to situate. I recommend getting a good-sized plant to start with, otherwise it will be useless for a long time.

Flowers easily, but becomes bitter.

### Info
Sun: Full
Water: Likes moisture, prefers short bursts of heavy
Soil: Any well-drained
Problems: Takes a while to root
Overwinters? Never

## Cilantro
Scientific: _Coriandrum sativum_

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%

Cilantro can be a hit-or-miss with many, but it can be very good when used correctly. Make sure to only eat the lower leaves when the plant is bolting: the top ones taste like stinkbug.

The plant will bolt after any decent rain and it grows fast. The flowers are a nice white and the seeds (Coriander) are often used as a spice.

### Info
Sun: Full or partial shade
Water: Likes moisture, not picky
Soil: Any, slightly acidic
Problems: Hit-or-miss flavor
Overwinters? Never

## Vietnamese Coriander
Scientific: _Persicaria odorata_

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%

Thai Coriander is similar to Cilantro but has a much stronger flavor. It will numb the tongue if you use too much. Eating even half of a leaf will overwhelm your mouth, but it is very good.

It tends to grow lush, so give it some space, though you don't need much.

### Info
Sun: Full or partial shade
Water: Likes a good watering
Soil: Well-Draining
Problems: Hit-or-miss flavor
Overwinters? Never

## Lemon Balm
Scientific: *Melissa officinalis*

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%

Lemon Balm is similar to mint in many ways, though it is a bit more picky. It has a subtle flavor and can be used for teas.

Can become woody and leggy if not trimmed.

### Info
Sun: Full
Water: Similar to mint
Soil: Any, alkaline
Problems: Meh flavor
Overwinters? Maybe

## Bergamot
Scientific: _Monarda fistulosa_

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%

Bergamot can make a somewhat spicy tea, though it isn't super strong. 

Bees love the plant, hence the nickname "Bee Balm". 
### Info
Sun: Full
Water: Similar to mint
Soil: Well-drained, not too rich
Problems: Somewhat slow growth, prone to mildew
Overwinters? Yes

## Tomato
Scientific: _Solanum lycopersicum_

%% Leaf Shape Sketch %%

Tomatoes are one of the easiest and best vegetables that you can grow. They are pretty much plant and harvest and they don't require much pruning, if any.

There are many varieties of tomatoes, and each one has different behaviors. Most benefit from a cage/trellis and good soil. 
They are most often divided into two groups: 
- **Determinate**: Compact, fruitful at once 
- **Indeterminate**: Vine-like, continuous growth, some maintenance

### Info
Sun: Full
Water: Lots, no puddling
Soil: Well-drained, alkaline
Problems: Needs a cage for best growth
Overwinters? No
